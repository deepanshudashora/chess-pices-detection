YOLO -->> you only look at once is getting popular day by  day with new version

in this case a popular problem of chess pieses detection and classification becomes a tough problem for us but yolo makes it easy

for this I am using the labelled data set which is available on internet
#Huge shouout to roboflow website which provides open source datasets for free

now in this case i am using yolov5 and doing the final classfication
I also used yolov3 but it was taking a whole lot if time for it (61 hours of training)

we can use this application for making a fully connected chess engine which playes chess like a human
